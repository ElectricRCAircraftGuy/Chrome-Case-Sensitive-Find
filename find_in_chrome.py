Associate this script with an **operating system shortcut** (whether on Windows, Mac, or Linux),
such as Ctrl + Shift + F (my preference) or Ctrl + Alt + F. Press that shortcut while in Chrome and
it will run this script, which  will run the case-insensitive-search Javascript program in Chrome by
pressing Ctrl + L to go to  the address bar and then typing `657search198` to activate your custom
search you should have already attached to this Javascript script.
